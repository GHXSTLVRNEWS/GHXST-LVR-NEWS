    <p class="date">Posted 01.28.26</p>

    <p>
      Motionless In White are officially back with “Afraid of the Dark,”
      a track that blends haunting atmosphere with crushing riffs and raw emotion.
      The song feels like a reminder of why MIW continues to dominate the modern
      metalcore scene while staying true to their roots.

    <p>
      From eerie vocals to massive breakdowns, this release sets the tone for what
      could be the next era of the band. If this track is any indication,
      things are about to get loud.
